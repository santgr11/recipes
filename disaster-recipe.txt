The cook in Lumbridge has a surprisingly small number of ingredients to 
hand in his kitchen, possibly as a result of an endless stream of newcomers with

Almost all members may attempt to solve his tricky predicament, and 
be rewarded accordingly, but only the very elite of Questers will be 
able to put an end to his problem permanently!
